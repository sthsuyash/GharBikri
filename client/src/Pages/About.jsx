                                    everyone. We believe that transportation is a fundamental
                                    human need, and that it should not be a luxury reserved for
                                    the few. We envision a world where people can explore the
                                    world on their own terms, without having to worry about the
                                    expense and hassle of traditional car rental services. A world
                                    where renting a car or bike is as easy as booking a hotel room
                                    or ordering food online.
